# embTools

Open source browser based toolset for the most common conversions, stitch run timer and a quoting form for embroiderers to use to help quote for embroidery projects.

# Purpose

Main purpose of this started out for something that I could use that had all the most common tools that I needed to accurately quote a project all in one central location.

Conversions, although a search away, was always having to do a quick search to get to them.

The stitch run time calculators that I had used previously usually only focused on stitch count and machine speed.  While amount of trims and how long it took for a machine to handle a trim were often ignored.  And depending on what machine one had and how long it took to handle a trim, this could add a significant amount of time to the project that may not be thought of.

It can also help when looking at stock designs to purchase and how long those designs will take and be able to accurately quote that before the purchase is made.

The quoting module came about when there was a need for something more automated then always having to do it by pen and paper.  After everything has been field out in the form, it can then be printed either to a physical copy or to a file for archiving.

# Installation

Installation requires Yarn and Electron-Builder.

Install Yarn based on the instructions for your particular platform.

Add Electron-Builder to your project using:

'yarn add electron-builder --dev'

then:

'yarn electron-builder build' 

That will build for the particular platform that you are on (setup for either Linux or Windows right now).
